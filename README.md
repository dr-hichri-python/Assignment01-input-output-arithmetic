# Coding Assignment: [Assignment Title]

Welcome to the coding assignment! This repository contains the assignment notebook and instructions for submission and peer review.

## Assignment Instructions

1. Complete the coding tasks in the provided Jupyter notebook file: `assignment.ipynb`.
2. Make sure your code runs without errors and produces the expected outputs.
3. Follow best coding practices: write clean, readable code with comments where necessary.
4. Commit your changes regularly and push your final version to your repository.

## Submission

- Submit your completed notebook by pushing your final changes to your GitHub repository.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) titled: `Assignment Submission - [Your Full Name]`.
- Ensure your PR includes a brief summary of your approach and any assumptions made.

## Peer Review Process

Each student will be assigned 2-3 peers' submissions to review. You will:

1. Review the assigned PRs using GitHub's code review tools.
2. Provide constructive feedback by commenting on specific lines of code.
3. Fill out the peer review rubric below as a comment in the PR.
4. Approve the PR if it meets the criteria or request changes if necessary.

## Peer Review Rubric

Please evaluate your peer's submission based on the following criteria. Assign a score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for each category and provide comments.

| Criteria               | Description                                                                 | Score (1-5) | Comments                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Functionality**       | Does the code correctly solve the problem and produce expected results?     |             |                                  |
| **Code Readability**    | Is the code well-organized, easy to read, and properly commented?           |             |                                  |
| **Efficiency**         | Is the code optimized and efficient in terms of time and space complexity?  |             |                                  |
| **Use of Python Features** | Does the code make good use of Python language features and libraries?    |             |                                  |
| **Documentation**      | Are the code and notebook well-documented with explanations and comments?   |             |                                  |

## Tips for Effective Peer Review

- Be respectful and constructive in your feedback.
- Focus on the code and not the coder.
- Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems.
- Ask clarifying questions if something is unclear.

## Support

If you have any questions or issues, please contact the instructor.

Good luck and happy coding!
